# Bitcoin-Price-Prediction
Using Machine Learning Algorithms to predict the Bitcoin Price

## Project Description:
Read data into Jupyter notebook, use pandas to import data into a data frame
Preprocess data: Explore data, check for missing data and apply data scaling. Justify the type of scaling used.
## Regression Task:
Apply all the regression models you've learned so far. If your model has a scaling parameter(s) use Grid Search to find the best hyper-parameter. Use plots and graphs to help you get a better glimpse of the results.
Then use cross-validation to find average training and testing score.
Your submission should have at least the following regression models: KNN repressor, linear regression, Ridge, Lasso, polynomial regression, SVM both simple and with kernels (rbf, poly, linear), Decison Tree Regressor.
Finally, find the best regressor for this dataset and train your model on the entire dataset using the best parameters and predict the target values for the test_set.
